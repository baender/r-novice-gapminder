Modified Workshop of SWCs: R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis
======================================

Based on the Software Carpentry Lesson "R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis", this is a modified version which covers the following 5 sessions:

1 Introduction to R and Rstudio
2 Functions and testing
3 Vectorization
4 Making Packages in R
5 Tidyverse and plotting with ggplot

This workshop is meant for people with some prior knowledge of R.
The idea was to choose important topics for reproducible research standards within the field of earth-science.
Many people here use R but there is still a lack of "getting the bigger picture" with respect to certain publication standards concerning code and data.
The goal is therefore to broaden the horizon of what is possible and what is necessary, so every participant
has the change to adapt their own coding research structure afterwards with all or parts of the content convered.

These sessions are mainly using the [Gapminder][gapminder] data.

The original SWC Lesson can be found here: <https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder>.

Note that this workshop focuses on the fundamentals of the programming
language R, and not on statistical analysis.

A variety of third party packages are used throughout this workshop. These
are not necessarily the best, nor are they comprehensive, but they are 
packages we find useful, and have been chosen primarily for their 
usability.
