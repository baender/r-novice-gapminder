# Factors

Factors are used to represent categorical data. Factors can be ordered or
unordered and are an important class for statistical analysis and for plotting.

Factors are stored as integers, and have labels associated with these unique
integers. While factors look (and often behave) like character vectors, they are
actually integers under the hood, and you need to be careful when treating them
like strings.

Once created, factors can only contain a pre-defined set values, known as
*levels*. By default, R always sorts *levels* in alphabetical order. For
instance, if you have a factor with 2 levels:

> ## The `factor()` Command
>
> The `factor()` command is used to create and modify factors in R:
>
> 
> ~~~
> sex <- factor(c("male", "female", "female", "male"))
> ~~~
> {: .r}
{: .callout}

R will assign `1` to the level `"female"` and `2` to the level `"male"` (because
`f` comes before `m`, even though the first element in this vector is
`"male"`). You can check this by using the function `levels()`, and check the
number of levels using `nlevels()`:


~~~
levels(sex)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] "female" "male"  
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
nlevels(sex)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 2
~~~
{: .output}

Sometimes, the order of the factors does not matter, other times you might want
to specify the order because it is meaningful (e.g., "low", "medium", "high") or
it is required by particular type of analysis. Additionally, specifying the
order of the levels allows us to compare levels:


~~~
food <- factor(c("low", "high", "medium", "high", "low", "medium", "high"))
levels(food)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] "high"   "low"    "medium"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
food <- factor(food, levels = c("low", "medium", "high"))
levels(food)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] "low"    "medium" "high"  
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
min(food) ## doesn't work
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
Error in Summary.factor(structure(c(1L, 3L, 2L, 3L, 1L, 2L, 3L), .Label = c("low", : 'min' not meaningful for factors
~~~
{: .error}



~~~
food <- factor(food, levels = c("low", "medium", "high"), ordered=TRUE)
levels(food)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] "low"    "medium" "high"  
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
min(food) ## works!
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] low
Levels: low < medium < high
~~~
{: .output}

In R's memory, these factors are represented by numbers (1, 2, 3). They are
better than using simple integer labels because factors are self describing:
`"low"`, `"medium"`, and `"high"`" is more descriptive than `1`, `2`, `3`. Which
is low?  You wouldn't be able to tell with just integer data. Factors have this
information built in. It is particularly helpful when there are many levels
(like the subjects in our example data set).

###  Converting Factors

Converting from a factor to a number can cause problems:


~~~
f <- factor(c(3.4, 1.2, 5))
as.numeric(f)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 2 1 3
~~~
{: .output}

This does not behave as expected (and there is no warning).

The recommended way is to use the integer vector to index the factor levels:


~~~
levels(f)[f]
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] "3.4" "1.2" "5"  
~~~
{: .output}

This returns a character vector, the `as.numeric()` function is still required to convert the values to the proper type (numeric).


~~~
f <- levels(f)[f]
f <- as.numeric(f)
~~~
{: .r}

# `dplyr()`:



Manipulation of dataframes means many things to many researchers, we often
select certain observations (rows) or variables (columns), we often group the
data by a certain variable(s), or we even calculate summary statistics. We can
do these operations using the normal base R operations:


~~~
mean(gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Africa", "gdpPercap"])
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 2193.755
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
mean(gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Americas", "gdpPercap"])
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 7136.11
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
mean(gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Asia", "gdpPercap"])
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 7902.15
~~~
{: .output}

But this isn't very *nice* because there is a fair bit of repetition. Repeating
yourself will cost you time, both now and later, and potentially introduce some
nasty bugs.

## The `dplyr` package

Luckily, the [`dplyr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/dplyr.pdf)
package provides a number of very useful functions for manipulating dataframes
in a way that will reduce the above repetition, reduce the probability of making
errors, and probably even save you some typing. As an added bonus, you might
even find the `dplyr` grammar easier to read.

Here we're going to cover 6 of the most commonly used functions as well as using
pipes (`%>%`) to combine them.

1. `select()`
2. `filter()`
3. `group_by()`
4. `summarize()`
5. `mutate()`

If you have have not installed this package earlier, please do so:


~~~
install.packages('dplyr')
~~~
{: .r}

Now let's load the package:


~~~
library("dplyr")
~~~
{: .r}

## Using select()

If, for example, we wanted to move forward with only a few of the variables in
our dataframe we could use the `select()` function. This will keep only the
variables you select.


~~~
year_country_gdp <- select(gapminder,year,country,gdpPercap)
~~~
{: .r}

![](../fig/13-dplyr-fig1.png)

If we open up `year_country_gdp` we'll see that it only contains the year,
country and gdpPercap. Above we used 'normal' grammar, but the strengths of
`dplyr` lie in combining several functions using pipes. Since the pipes grammar
is unlike anything we've seen in R before, let's repeat what we've done above
using pipes.


~~~
year_country_gdp <- gapminder %>% select(year,country,gdpPercap)
~~~
{: .r}

To help you understand why we wrote that in that way, let's walk through it step
by step. First we summon the gapminder dataframe and pass it on, using the pipe
symbol `%>%`, to the next step, which is the `select()` function. In this case
we don't specify which data object we use in the `select()` function since in
gets that from the previous pipe. **Fun Fact**: There is a good chance you have
encountered pipes before in the shell. In R, a pipe symbol is `%>%` while in the
shell it is `|` but the concept is the same!

## Using filter()

If we now wanted to move forward with the above, but only with European
countries, we can combine `select` and `filter`


~~~
year_country_gdp_euro <- gapminder %>%
    filter(continent=="Europe") %>%
    select(year,country,gdpPercap)
~~~
{: .r}

> ## Challenge 1
>
> Write a single command (which can span multiple lines and includes pipes) that
> will produce a dataframe that has the African values for `lifeExp`, `country`
> and `year`, but not for other Continents.  How many rows does your dataframe

>
> > ## Solution to Challenge 1

> >year_country_lifeExp_Africa <- gapminder %>%
> >                            filter(continent=="Africa") %>%
> >                            select(year,country,lifeExp)
> >~~~
> >{: .r}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

As with last time, first we pass the gapminder dataframe to the `filter()`
function, then we pass the filtered version of the gapminder dataframe to the
`select()` function. **Note:** The order of operations is very important in this
case. If we used 'select' first, filter would not be able to find the variable
continent since we would have removed it in the previous step.

## Using group_by() and summarize()

Now, we were supposed to be reducing the error prone repetitiveness of what can
be done with base R, but up to now we haven't done that since we would have to
repeat the above for each continent. Instead of `filter()`, which will only pass
observations that meet your criteria (in the above: `continent=="Europe"`), we
can use `group_by()`, which will essentially use every unique criteria that you
could have used in filter.


~~~
str(gapminder)
~~~

  .. ..$ : symbol continent
  ..- attr(*, "drop")= logi TRUE
~~~
{: .output}
You will notice that the structure of the dataframe where we used `group_by()`
(`grouped_df`) is not the same as the original `gapminder` (`data.frame`). A
`grouped_df` can be thought of as a `list` where each item in the `list`is a
`data.frame` which contains only the rows that correspond to the a particular
value `continent` (at least in the example above).

![](../fig/13-dplyr-fig2.png)

## Using summarize()

The above was a bit on the uneventful side because `group_by()` much more
exciting in conjunction with `summarize()`. This will allow use to create new
variable(s) by using functions that repeat for each of the continent-specific
data frames. That is to say, using the `group_by()` function, we split our
original dataframe into multiple pieces, then we can run functions
(e.g. `mean()` or `sd()`) within `summarize()`.


~~~
gdp_bycontinents <- gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap=mean(gdpPercap))
~~~
{: .r}

![](../fig/13-dplyr-fig3.png)

That allowed us to calculate the mean gdpPercap for each continent, but it gets
even better.

The function `group_by()` allows us to group by multiple variables. Let's group by `year` and `continent`.



~~~
gdp_bycontinents_byyear <- gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent,year) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap=mean(gdpPercap))
~~~
{: .r}

That is already quite powerful, but it gets even better! You're not limited to defining 1 new variable in `summarize()`.


~~~
gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear <- gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent,year) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap=mean(gdpPercap),
              sd_gdpPercap=sd(gdpPercap),
              mean_pop=mean(pop),
              sd_pop=sd(pop))
~~~
{: .r}

## Using mutate()

We can also create new variables prior to (or even after) summarizing information using `mutate()`.


~~~
gdp_pop_bycontinents_byyear <- gapminder %>%
    mutate(gdp_billion=gdpPercap*pop/10^9) %>%
    group_by(continent,year) %>%
    summarize(mean_gdpPercap=mean(gdpPercap),
              sd_gdpPercap=sd(gdpPercap),
              mean_pop=mean(pop),
              sd_pop=sd(pop),
              mean_gdp_billion=mean(gdp_billion),
              sd_gdp_billion=sd(gdp_billion))
~~~
{: .r}

# ggplot2



Plotting our data is one of the best ways to
quickly explore it and the various relationships
between variables.

There are three main plotting systems in R,
the [base plotting system][base], the [lattice][lattice]
package, and the [ggplot2][ggplot2] package.

[base]: http://www.statmethods.net/graphs/
[lattice]: http://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/trellis.html
[ggplot2]: http://www.statmethods.net/advgraphs/ggplot2.html

Today we'll be learning about the ggplot2 package, because
it is the most effective for creating publication quality
graphics.

ggplot2 is built on the grammar of graphics, the idea that any plot can be
expressed from the same set of components: a **data** set, a
**coordinate system**, and a set of **geoms**--the visual representation of data
points.

The key to understanding ggplot2 is thinking about a figure in layers.
This idea may be familiar to you if you have used image editing programs like Photoshop, Illustrator, or
Inkscape.

Let's start off with an example:


~~~
library("ggplot2")
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point()
~~~
{: .r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-08-lifeExp-vs-gdpPercap-scatter-1.png" title="plot of chunk lifeExp-vs-gdpPercap-scatter" alt="plot of chunk lifeExp-vs-gdpPercap-scatter" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

So the first thing we do is call the `ggplot` function. This function lets R
know that we're creating a new plot, and any of the arguments we give the
`ggplot` function are the *global* options for the plot: they apply to all
layers on the plot.

We've passed in two arguments to `ggplot`. First, we tell `ggplot` what data we
want to show on our figure, in this example the gapminder data we read in
earlier. For the second argument we passed in the `aes` function, which
tells `ggplot` how variables in the **data** map to *aesthetic* properties of
the figure, in this case the **x** and **y** locations. Here we told `ggplot` we
want to plot the "gdpPercap" column of the gapminder data frame on the x-axis, and
the "lifeExp" column on the y-axis. Notice that we didn't need to explicitly
pass `aes` these columns (e.g. `x = gapminder[, "gdpPercap"]`), this is because
`ggplot` is smart enough to know to look in the **data** for that column!

By itself, the call to `ggplot` isn't enough to draw a figure:


~~~
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))
~~~
{: .r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-08-unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-19" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-19" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

We need to tell `ggplot` how we want to visually represent the data, which we
do by adding a new **geom** layer. In our example, we used `geom_point`, which
tells `ggplot` we want to visually represent the relationship between **x** and
**y** as a scatterplot of points:


~~~
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point()
~~~
{: .r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-08-lifeExp-vs-gdpPercap-scatter2-1.png" title="plot of chunk lifeExp-vs-gdpPercap-scatter2" alt="plot of chunk lifeExp-vs-gdpPercap-scatter2" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

## Layers

Using a scatterplot probably isn't the best for visualizing change over time.
Instead, let's tell `ggplot` to visualize the data as a line plot:


~~~
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, by=country, color=continent)) +
  geom_line()
~~~
{: .r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-08-lifeExp-line-1.png" title="plot of chunk lifeExp-line" alt="plot of chunk lifeExp-line" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Instead of adding a `geom_point` layer, we've added a `geom_line` layer. We've
added the **by** *aesthetic*, which tells `ggplot` to draw a line for each
country.

But what if we want to visualize both lines and points on the plot? We can
simply add another layer to the plot:


~~~
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, by=country, color=continent)) +
  geom_line() + geom_point()
~~~
{: .r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-08-lifeExp-line-point-1.png" title="plot of chunk lifeExp-line-point" alt="plot of chunk lifeExp-line-point" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

It's important to note that each layer is drawn on top of the previous layer. In
this example, the points have been drawn *on top of* the lines. Here's a
demonstration:


~~~
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, by=country)) +
  geom_line(aes(color=continent)) + geom_point()
~~~
{: .r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-08-lifeExp-layer-example-1-1.png" title="plot of chunk lifeExp-layer-example-1" alt="plot of chunk lifeExp-layer-example-1" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

In this example, the *aesthetic* mapping of **color** has been moved from the
global plot options in `ggplot` to the `geom_line` layer so it no longer applies
to the points. Now we can clearly see that the points are drawn on top of the
lines.

> So far, we've seen how to use an aesthetic (such as **color**) as a *mapping* to a variable in the data. For example, when we use `geom_line(aes(color=continent))`, ggplot will give a different color to each continent. But what if we want to change the colour of all lines to blue? You may think that `geom_line(aes(color="blue"))` should work, but it doesn't. Since we don't want to create a mapping to a specific variable, we simply move the color specification outside of the `aes()` function, like this: `geom_line(color="blue")`.

## Transformations and statistics

Ggplot also makes it easy to overlay statistical models over the data. To
demonstrate we'll go back to our first example:


~~~
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color=continent)) +
  geom_point()
~~~
{: .r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-08-lifeExp-vs-gdpPercap-scatter3-1.png" title="plot of chunk lifeExp-vs-gdpPercap-scatter3" alt="plot of chunk lifeExp-vs-gdpPercap-scatter3" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Currently it's hard to see the relationship between the points due to some strong
outliers in GDP per capita. We can change the scale of units on the x axis using
the *scale* functions. These control the mapping between the data values and
visual values of an aesthetic. We can also modify the transparency of the
points, using the *alpha* function, which is especially helpful when you have
a large amount of data which is very clustered.


~~~
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + scale_x_log10()
~~~
{: .r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-08-axis-scale-1.png" title="plot of chunk axis-scale" alt="plot of chunk axis-scale" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The `log10` function applied a transformation to the values of the gdpPercap
column before rendering them on the plot, so that each multiple of 10 now only
corresponds to an increase in 1 on the transformed scale, e.g. a GDP per capita
of 1,000 is now 3 on the y axis, a value of 10,000 corresponds to 4 on the y
axis and so on. This makes it easier to visualize the spread of data on the
x-axis.

> ## Tip Reminder: Setting an aesthetic to a value instead of a mapping
>
> Notice that we used `geom_point(alpha = 0.5)`. As the previous tip mentioned, using a setting outside of the `aes()` function will cause this value to be used for all points, which is what we want in this case. But just like any other aesthetic setting, *alpha* can also be mapped to a variable in the data. For example, we can give a different transparency to each continent with `geom_point(aes(alpha = continent))`.
{: .callout}

We can fit a simple relationship to the data by adding another layer,
`geom_smooth`:


~~~
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() + scale_x_log10() + geom_smooth(method="lm")
~~~
{: .r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-08-lm-fit-1.png" title="plot of chunk lm-fit" alt="plot of chunk lm-fit" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

We can make the line thicker by *setting* the **size** aesthetic in the
`geom_smooth` layer:


~~~
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() + scale_x_log10() + geom_smooth(method="lm", size=1.5)
~~~
{: .r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-08-lm-fit2-1.png" title="plot of chunk lm-fit2" alt="plot of chunk lm-fit2" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

There are two ways an *aesthetic* can be specified. Here we *set* the **size**
aesthetic by passing it as an argument to `geom_smooth`. Previously in the
lesson we've used the `aes` function to define a *mapping* between data
variables and their visual representation.

## Multi-panel figures

Earlier we visualized the change in life expectancy over time across all
countries in one plot. Alternatively, we can split this out over multiple panels
by adding a layer of **facet** panels. Focusing only on those countries with
names that start with the letter "A" or "Z".

> ## Tip
>
> We start by subsetting the data.  We use the `substr` function to

> `starts.with %in% c("A", "Z")` is equivalent to
> `starts.with == "A" | starts.with == "Z"`)
{: .callout}

Using `dplyr` functions also helps us simplify things, for example we could
combine the first two steps:


~~~
gapminder %>%
    # Filter countries that start with "A" or "Z"
	filter(substr(country, start = 1, stop = 1) %in% c("A", "Z")) %>%
	# Make the plot
	ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) + 
	geom_line() + 
	facet_wrap( ~ country)
~~~
{: .r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-08-unnamed-chunk-21-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-21" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-21" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The `facet_wrap` layer took a "formula" as its argument, denoted by the tilde
(~). This tells R to draw a panel for each unique value in the country column
of the gapminder dataset.

This is a taste of what you can do with `ggplot2`. RStudio provides a
really useful [cheat sheet][cheat] of the different layers available, and more
extensive documentation is available on the [ggplot2 website][ggplot-doc].
Finally, if you have no idea how to change something, a quick Google search will
usually send you to a relevant question and answer on Stack Overflow with reusable
code to modify!
